If you have just a few web browser tabs open, your laptop battery drains rapidly. And don&rsquo;t get me started on those videos that automatically play when you&rsquo;re scrolling through a webpage.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"74\">The web has reached a new low. It has become an annoying, often toxic and occasionally unsafe place to hang out. More important, it has become an unfair trade: You give up your privacy online, and what you get in return are somewhat convenient services and hyper-targeted ads.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"75\">That&rsquo;s why it may be time to try a different browser. Remember Firefox? The browser, made by the nonprofit Mozilla, emerged in the early 2000s as a faster, better designed vessel to surf the web. But it became irrelevant after <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/technology/02google.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"417\">Google in 2008 released Chrome</a>, a faster, more secure and versatile browser.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"76\">Mozilla recently hit the reset button on Firefox. About two years ago, six Mozilla employees were huddled around a bonfire one night in Santa Cruz, Calif., when they began discussing the state of web browsers. Eventually, they concluded there was a &ldquo;crisis of confidence&rdquo; in the web.</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\" nodeIndex=\"418\"><span nodeIndex=\"419\"></span></aside></div><div class=\"css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" nodeIndex=\"77\"><div class=\"css-1h6whtw\" nodeIndex=\"78\"><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"79\">&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t trust the web, they won&rsquo;t use the web,&rdquo; Mark Mayo, Mozilla&rsquo;s chief product officer, said in an interview. &ldquo;That just felt to us like that actually might be the direction we&rsquo;re going. And so we started to think about tools and architectures and different approaches.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"80\">Now Firefox is back. Mozilla released a new version late last year, code-named Quantum. It is sleekly designed and fast; Mozilla said the revamped <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"420\">Firefox consumes less memory</a> than the competition, meaning you can fire up lots of tabs and browsing will still feel buttery smooth.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"81\">Most notably, Firefox now offers privacy tools, like a built-in feature for blocking ad trackers and a &ldquo;container&rdquo; that can be installed to prevent Facebook from monitoring your activities across the web. Most other browsers don&rsquo;t include those features.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"82\">After testing Firefox for the last three months, I found it to be on a par with Chrome in most categories. In the end, Firefox&rsquo;s thoughtful privacy features persuaded me to make the switch and make it my primary browser.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"83\">Here&rsquo;s why you should consider it, too.</p><h2 class=\"css-1ljmzo6 eqpy7av0\" nodeIndex=\"84\">Privacy Features   <br nodeIndex=\"421\"></h2><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"85\">Both Chrome and Firefox support thousands of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/smarter-living/browser-extensions-text-swapping.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"422\">extensions</a>, which are add-ons that modify your browsing experience. Chrome wins in terms of numbers, with hundreds of thousands of extensions compared with Firefox&rsquo;s roughly 11,000.</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\" nodeIndex=\"423\"><span nodeIndex=\"424\"></span></aside></div><div class=\"css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" nodeIndex=\"86\"><div class=\"css-1h6whtw\" nodeIndex=\"87\"><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"88\">But in months of using Firefox, there wasn&rsquo;t anything I wanted to do on Chrome that I couldn&rsquo;t also do on Firefox. Both browsers support <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://1password.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"425\">1Password</a>, the popular password-management program. Both support extensions that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/technology/personaltech/stopping-video-autoplay-on-google-chrome.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"426\">prevent videos from automatically</a> playing when you visit websites. And both support <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"427\">uBlock Origin</a>, the ad blocker recommended by many security experts.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"89\">Mozilla also offers a Firefox extension called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/?src=search\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"428\">Facebook Container</a>. Normally, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/technology/personaltech/i-downloaded-the-information-that-facebook-has-on-me-yikes.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"429\">Facebook can track your browsing activities</a> even outside its social media site by using trackers planted on other websites like web cookies. With Mozilla&rsquo;s extension, when you open Facebook in a browser tab, it isolates your Facebook identity into its own container, making it difficult for the social network to follow you outside its site.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"90\">Firefox especially stood out for some privacy features that are baked into the browser. Inside the privacy settings, you can turn on tracking protection, which blocks online trackers from collecting your browser data across multiple websites. With Chrome, you can install a third-party extension to block trackers &mdash; but the fewer add-ons you have to tack onto your browser, the better.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"91\">Security experts applauded Mozilla for stepping up its efforts on privacy.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"92\">&ldquo;Firefox does seem to have positioned itself as the privacy-friendly browser, and they have been doing a fantastic job improving security as well,&rdquo; said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights nonprofit. &ldquo;On the other hand, Google is fundamentally an advertising company, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that they will ever have a business interest in making Chrome more privacy friendly.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"93\">Google said that privacy and security went hand in hand, and that it led the industry on both fronts. The search giant said it had the only browser with a method for reliably addressing Spectre, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/computer-flaws.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"430\">security flaw that was revealed this year</a> and that cannot be completely fixed. Spectre affects the microprocessors in nearly all of the world&rsquo;s computers, and it can allow the theft of information from one application so that it can be shared with another. Chrome also includes a built-in filter that blocks inappropriate, malicious ads from loading.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"94\">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have privacy without security on the web,&rdquo; said Parisa Tabriz, a director of engineering for Google who specializes in security.</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\" nodeIndex=\"431\"><span nodeIndex=\"432\"></span></aside></div><div class=\"css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" nodeIndex=\"95\"><div class=\"css-1h6whtw\" nodeIndex=\"96\"><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"97\">In fact, both Chrome and Firefox have tough security. Both include sandboxing, which isolates processes of the browser so a harmful website doesn&rsquo;t infect other parts of your machine. So if you loaded a website with malicious code, it would be contained within the webpage so it couldn&rsquo;t infect your files, webcam and microphone.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"98\">Google said there was one thing it could do better on: the inclusion of privacy settings to block tracking technology, similar to the tools that Firefox includes.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"99\">&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s something that we can improve on,&rdquo; Ms. Tabriz said. &ldquo;Firefox has some settings that we&rsquo;re also exploring.&rdquo;</p><h2 class=\"css-1ljmzo6 eqpy7av0\" nodeIndex=\"100\">Speed and Battery Tests</h2><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"101\">Which browser is faster?</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"102\">Some benchmark websites, which determine the speed of a browser by measuring the responsiveness of different web elements, say <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"433\">Chrome is faster</a>. But some other benchmark sites say <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://browserbench.org/JetStream/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"434\">Firefox is faster</a>. In my anecdotal testing as someone who juggles more than a dozen web tabs at a time, both were very speedy. Let&rsquo;s call it a draw.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"103\">Mozilla&rsquo;s promise that Firefox consumes less computer memory raises hopes that it should also use less battery life. Yet in my tests on a laptop running a script that automatically reloaded the top 10 news sites, Firefox lasted only a few minutes longer than Chrome before the battery was depleted. On another test, which involved streaming a Netflix video on a loop on each browser, the battery lasted about 20 minutes longer when the Chrome browser was used.</p><h2 class=\"css-1ljmzo6 eqpy7av0\" nodeIndex=\"104\">Resurrection Is Just Beginning</h2><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"105\">Firefox is the No. 2 computer browser, with about 12 percent of the desktop browser market, lagging far behind Chrome, which has about 67 percent, according to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" nodeIndex=\"435\">StatCounter</a>. Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer and Apple&rsquo;s Safari browsers are even farther behind in the desktop market, with Explorer&rsquo;s share about 7 percent and Safari&rsquo;s about 5.5 percent. On Android phones, the Chrome browser is still far more popular than Firefox&rsquo;s mobile browser. And only lightweight versions of Firefox are available for Apple&rsquo;s iOS devices.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"106\">Yet the path forward for Mozilla looks increasingly promising for consumers.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"107\">In addition to the normal Firefox browser, Mozilla offers Firefox Focus, a privacy-centric mobile browser that blocks trackers by default and purges your web browsing history as soon as you close out of a page.</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\" nodeIndex=\"436\"><span nodeIndex=\"437\"></span></aside></div><div class=\"css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" nodeIndex=\"108\"><div class=\"css-1h6whtw\" nodeIndex=\"109\"><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"110\">These are privacy-conscious web products that Mozilla is in a position to expand on in the long term. The nonprofit has no direct relationship with advertisers; it gets a small sum from search providers like Google and Bing when a search is conducted through their sites using a Firefox product.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"111\">For Mozilla, there&rsquo;s a plus side to being the underdog.</p><p class=\"css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0\" nodeIndex=\"112\">&ldquo;The advantage of when you get beaten down is you kind of drop some of your own ego around your decisions,&rdquo; Mr. Mayo said. &ldquo;We had a lot less to lose.&rdquo;</p></div><aside class=\"css-14jsv4e\" nodeIndex=\"438\"><span nodeIndex=\"439\"></span></aside></div><span nodeIndex=\"440\"></span><div id=\"bottom-wrapper\" class=\"ResponsiveAd-bottomAd--1hHJW ResponsiveAd-storyBodyAd--35v2w\" nodeIndex=\"186\"><div id=\"bottom-slug\" class=\"ResponsiveAd-adSlug--3H3QM\" nodeIndex=\"187\"><p nodeIndex=\"188\">Advertisement</p></div></div><div style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:11px;line-height:12.5px;opacity:0.8;padding-top:12px;padding-bottom:12px;\">&copy; 2018 The New York Times Company.<br><br>\n\t\t\t\tThe content you have chosen to save (which may include videos, articles, \n\t\t\t\timages and other copyrighted materials) is intended for your personal, noncommercial use. \n\t\t\t\tSuch content is owned or controlled by The New York Times Company or the party credited \n\t\t\t\tas the content provider.
